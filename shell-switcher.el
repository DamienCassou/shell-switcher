;;; commentary:
;;
;; After you add the following line to your Emacs init file you will
;; switch easily between shell buffers:
;;
;; (require 'shell-switcher)
;;
;; You have to customize `shell-switcher-new-shell-function' if
;; `eshell' is not your shell of choice.
;;
;;; code:
;;
;; The following code uses the "sswitcher" prefix for all "private"
;; functions (and an addition dash "-") and the "shell-switcher" prefix
;; for all "public" functions.
